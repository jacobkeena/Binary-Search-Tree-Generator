I've been doing some research on binary search trees and thought I might be able to make an app that would generate one
using random values. Ideally, I would like to be able to designate the amount of numbers being added as well as an upper and lower bound
for the random number generator to choose from. These would then be displayed to the screen as strings just to show it worked. 
Then provide a feature to be able to search the tree and look for numbers inside of it. 

I still have a long way to go though! Any feedback or suggestions are most welcome.
